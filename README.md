## Author's Info

Samuel --> My name is Samuel Andelin, I am in a programming class where I get to code stuff, which is pretty fun. I like to play videogames and like to code as well. I mostly code in Python, but I have coded in some Rust. I definitely prefer python because it is a lot less hassle to be secure, but that is probably more important than it being easy.

Max --> 
Aaron -->
Gabe --> My name is Gabriel Crozier, I am currently doing a computer science class. I love video games, Minecraft and Roblox being one of the top things I play. I code only in python for now.
